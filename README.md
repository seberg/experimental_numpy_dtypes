**Crude examples using the new, experimental, DType API of NumPy**

This repository uses the new *experimental* NumPy DType and UFunc API.
Expect this to work on the NumPy main branch (although
at the time of writing this, it is not in yet, check the PR list).

This is an early stage, so I will not take care about clean changesets.
Right now I expect to move this to the NumPy organization as soon
as the dust settles and things actually work.

I decided to use ``cython`` here, but I may change my mind or
do C and Cython depending for different things, the idea was that
it may be more useful.

However, creating the correct DType is ugly in Cython, because as
of now it is only clean if creating a static type in C.
I hope to improve this, but it may require working with Python.

Creating a new ufunc loop is fine in cython though.

Please check the NumPy ``experimental_dtype_api.h`` header, the NEPs,
or ping me for more information.

What is possible?

```python
from experimental_user_dtypes import float64unit as u, string_funcs; import numpy as np

F = np.array([u.Quantity(70., "Fahrenheit")])
C = F.astype(u.Float64UnitDType("Celsius"))
print(repr(C))
# array([21.11111111111115 Â°C], dtype='Float64UnitDType(degC)')

m = np.array([u.Quantity(5., "m")])
m_squared = u.multiply(m, m)
print(repr(m_squared))
# array([25.0 m**2], dtype='Float64UnitDType(m**2)')

# If `string_funcs` is imported, this also works (i.e. `np.equal` with strings)
np.equal(np.array(["string"], dtype="S"), np.array(["other_string"], dtype="S"))
# array([False])
```
(Please don't multiple units that can't be multiply, it may crash and I have not checked
why yet.  Reductions do NOT work as of writing this, that is an open PR to NumPy.)

There is also a string comparison function in `string_funcs.string_equal` that works on
the NumPy bytes ("S" not "U") dtype.
